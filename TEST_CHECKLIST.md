## Test Breakdown

### HasReactions Trait (20 tests)
```
✅ Model can have reactions relationship
✅ User can react to a model
✅ User can unreact from a model
✅ Unreact returns false when user has not reacted
✅ Can check if user has reacted to model
✅ Can get user reaction type
✅ Reacting replaces existing reaction
✅ Multiple users can react to same model
✅ Get reactions summary returns count by type
✅ Get total reactions count returns correct number
✅ Get reactions count by type returns correct number
✅ WithReactions scope adds reactions count
✅ Popular scope orders by reactions count descending
✅ Popular scope can order ascending
✅ React throws exception when user is not provided and not authenticated
✅ Unreact returns false when user is not provided and not authenticated
✅ HasReactedBy returns false when user is not provided and not authenticated
✅ GetReactionBy returns null when user is not provided and not authenticated
✅ Reaction is polymorphic and can be used on different models
✅ Deleting model does not automatically cascade reactions without foreign keys
```

### Reaction Model (11 tests)
```
✅ Reaction can be created with fillable attributes
✅ Reaction belongs to user
✅ Reaction belongs to reactable model
✅ Reaction has timestamps
✅ Reaction timestamps are cast to datetime
✅ Reaction type can be any string
✅ Multiple reactions can exist for different users on same model
✅ Reaction enforces unique constraint per user per reactable
✅ Reaction can be deleted
✅ Reaction can be updated
✅ Reaction fillable attributes are protected
```

### Livewire Component (26 tests)
```
✅ Reactions component can be mounted
✅ Reactions component loads reaction types from config
✅ Authenticated user can add reaction
✅ Authenticated user can remove reaction
✅ Authenticated user can change reaction type
✅ Guest user cannot add reactions
✅ Reaction picker can be toggled
✅ Reaction picker can be closed
✅ Reactions list can be toggled
✅ Reactions list can be closed
✅ Reaction counts are displayed correctly
✅ Total reactions property calculates correctly
✅ Clicking same reaction type removes it
✅ Toggle reaction adds like when no reaction exists
✅ Toggle reaction removes existing reaction
✅ Invalid reaction type is ignored
✅ Picker closes after adding reaction
✅ Opening picker closes reactions list
✅ Opening reactions list closes picker
✅ Reaction users list loads correctly
✅ Reaction users can be filtered by type
✅ Component loads reactions with eager loaded data
✅ Component handles model without eager loaded reactions
✅ Reaction added event includes correct data
✅ Reaction removed event includes correct data
✅ Model type and id are locked and cannot be changed
```
